    <title>Development of Musical Synthesizers</title>
</head>

    <h1 class="header">Musical Synthesizers</h1>
    <p class="paragraph">   Synthesizers are interactive, specially designed computers that generate and modify sound through 
    frequency synthesis. Synths are usually controlled by a keyboard, but can also be controlled by a digital (digital synth) or tangible soundboard (analog synth).
    They reached their peak popularity in the 70's and 80's, but their musical influence both preceeds and suceeds these time periods.</p>

        <li class="listitems">The earliest and most primitve version of the synth was called the theremin (originally called the "etherphone"). 
            Invented in 1922 by Leon Theremin, the theramin produces a singular eerie, wailing sound. It is a relatively small but complicated 
            synth that is played, oddly enough, without any actual touching. In simplest terms, the theremin relies on the vibration frequency
            of your hands to control the pitch and volume of the sound that is produced.

        <li class="listitems">The Ondes Martenot synth, invented in 1928 by Maurice Martenot, is a bit more advanced than the theremin
            but not yet digital. Unlike the theremin, the Ondes Martenot synth relies on hands-on control consisting of: a piano, a pitch
            thread, and an oscillator.

        <li class="listitems">In 1952, American composer Raymond Scott invented the Clavivox with the help of future synth pioneer Bob Moog. 
            This synth was a fusion of a 3 octave piano, and oscilator, and the frequency principle of the theremin. It also the same attached thread and slider that the Ondes Martenot 
            synth included.

        <li class="listitems">The Moog synth and its miniature counterpart, the Minimoog, carry the line of synth development into more digitally
            progressive bounds. The Moog Modular was the first synth to be comerically manufactured, as it was the first offical musical synthesizer that acted 
            as more than a prototype or a trial. The science of artificial sound synthesis had been cultivated and perfected by the experimental
            synths that came before the Moog, so in a way this synth was the magnum opus of its time in development. Its inventor, Bob Moog, included many of his
            patented artificial sound synthesis devices in it, making the synth one of the most efficient and intricate at the time. The Minimoog was 
            the smaller, more consice "child" of the Moog Modular that made its revolutionary charcateristics more widely acessible.

        <li class="listitems">The Yamaha DX7, released in 1983 was the best selling and most efficient synth of its time, although there was
            some controversy surrounding it. This synth came with a multitude of pre-programmed sounds that made it a good choice for live performances,
            but some disliked this feature and felt it lacked dynamicy and character. Many of those who dislike the DX7 believe it is to blame for 
            the transition from creativity to genericy in electronic music. 
        </li>
        <li class="listitems">The Roland, Microkorg, and Eurorack synths are the leading synths in today's realm of music production.
            The Roland synths revolutionized modern house, dance, and trap music. Through experimentation using the Roland TB 303, a brand new 
            (to the time) genere of house, acid house, was created.
