    <h1 class="header">Musical Synthesizers</h1>
    <p class="paragraph">   Synthesizers are interactive, specially designed computers that generate and modify sound through 
    frequency synthesis. Synths are usually controlled by a keyboard, but can also be controlled by a digital or tangible soundboard.
    They reached their peak popularity in the 70's and 80's, but their musical influence both preceeds and suceeds these time periods.</p>

        <li class="listitems">The earliest and most primitve version of the synth was called the theremin (originally called the "etherphone"). 
            Invented in 1922 by Leon Theremin, the theramin produces a singular eerie, wailing sound. It is a relatively small but complicated 
            synth that is played, oddly enough, without any actual touching. In simplest terms, the theremin relies on the vibration frequency
            of your hands to control the pitch and volume of the sound that is produced.

        <li class="listitems">The Ondes Martenot synth, invented in 1928 by Maurice Martenot, is a bit more advanced than the theremin
            but not yet digital. Unlike the theremin, the Ondes Martenot synth relies on hands-on control consisting of: a piano, a pitch
            thread, and an oscillator.

        <li class="listitems">In 1952, the RCA invented the first digital synth that proudced artifical sound. This was called the Modsynth.
            This device was essentially the "blueprint" for the anatomy of a modern synth, it included: oscillators, filters, envelope generators,
            and noise circuits.

        <li class="listitems">The Moog synth and its miniature counterpart, the Minimoog, carry the line of synth development into more digitally
            progressive bounds.
        </li>
        <li class="listitems">The Yamaha DX7, released in 1983 was the best selling and most efficient synth of its time</li>
        <li class="listitems">The Roland, Microkorg, and Eurorack synths are the leading synths in today's realm of music production</li>
