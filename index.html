    <h1 class="header">Musical Synthesizers</h1>
    <p class="paragraph"> Synthesizers are interactive, specially designed computers that generate and modify sound through 
    frequency synthesis. Synths are usually controlled by either a digital soundboard model with a computer interface (digital synth) or tangible soundboard (analog synth).
    Through the manipulation of different kinds of waves (saw cut, square, triangle, and pulse) and modifiers (timbre, attack, or decay), a range of intersting 
    sounds can be created. They reached their peak popularity in the 70's and 80's, but their musical influence both preceeds and suceeds these time periods.</p>

        <li class="listitems"><a name="Theremin">The earliest and most primitve version of the synth was called the <i>theremin</i> (originally called the "etherphone"). 
            Invented in 1922 by Leon Theremin, the <i>theremin</i> produces a singular eerie, wailing sound. It is a relatively small but complicated 
            synth that is played, oddly enough, without any actual touching. In simplest terms, the <i>theremin</i> relies on the vibration frequency
            of your hands to control the pitch and volume of the sound that is produced.</a>
            <br>
            Price: $400-$1,00

        <li class="listitems"><a name="OndesMartenot">The <i>Ondes Martenot</i> synth, invented in 1928 by Maurice Martenot, is a bit more advanced than the theremin
            but not yet digital. Unlike the theremin, the <i>Ondes Martenot</i> synth relies on hands-on control. The synth consists of a keyboard/piano,
            a pitch thread with an attched ring, and a dynamics operator that slid out from an attched drawer. The idea of the synth was to
            create an instrument that has a quickly shifted between, wide pitch variable. To acheive this pitch variable, the player would
            insert their ring finger into the the metal ring and slide it across the attatched thread. The sound dynamics were created by pressing down
            on a glass bar in the dynamics operator. The original <i>Ondes Martenot</i> produced its sound via sine waves, but its later versions included
            the variety of waves (pulse,triangle, and square) that would become a foundational part of later synths.</a>
            <br>
            Price: Unknown, though an original model could be very expensive.

        <li class="listitems"><a name="Clavivox">In 1952, American composer Raymond Scott invented the <i>Clavivox</i> with the help of future synth pioneer Bob Moog. 
            This synth was a fusion of a 3 octave piano, and oscilator, and the frequency principle of the theremin. It was intened to emulate the same quick shifted pitch
            sound as the theremin, but be able to be played on a keyboard. A number of Raymond's other eletronic music inventions along with the <i>clavivox</i>
            were capable of emulating virtually any real-life sound. He and a team of other sound engineers made use of these machines' abilities in order to make 
            sound effects and music for cartoons. The most well known cartoon Scott used his synths to create sounds for is Looney Toones.
            <br>
            Price: Unknown, this model isn't popular anymore.

        <li class="listitems"><a name="MoogModular">The <i>Moog</i> synth and its miniature counterpart, the <i>Minimoog</i>, carry the line of synth development into more digitally
            progressive bounds. The <i>Moog Modular</i> was the first analog synth to be comerically manufactured, as it was the first offical musical synthesizer that acted 
            as more than a prototype or a trial. The science of artificial sound synthesis had been cultivated and perfected by the experimental
            synths that came before the <i>Moog</i>, so in a way this synth was the magnum opus of its time in development. Its inventor, Bob Moog, included many of his
            patented artificial sound synthesis devices in it, making the synth one of the most efficient and intricate at the time. The <i>Minimoog</i> was 
            the smaller, more consice "child" of the <i>Moog Modular</i> that made its revolutionary charcateristics more widely acessible.</a>

        <li class="listitems"><a name="DX7">The <i>Yamaha DX7</i>, released in 1983 was the best selling and most efficient synth of its time, although there was
            some controversy surrounding it. This synth came with a multitude of pre-programmed sounds that made it a good choice for live performances,
            but some disliked this feature and felt it lacked dynamicy and character. Unlike most synths that came before the <i>DX7</i>, it came in the form of a standard
            electric keyboard. There werent many adjustment or customization features, and because of this many of those who dislike the <i>DX7</i> believe it is to blame for the transition from creativity to genericy in electronic music.</a>

        <li class="listitems"><a name="ModSynths">The <i>Roland, Microkorg, and Eurorack</i> synths are the leading synths in today's realm of music production.
            The most revolutionary of the modern synth lineup are undoubtedly the <i>Roland TR 808 and the Roland TR 303</i>. Both of these synths
            are the foundation of dance, hip hop, and rap as we are familiar with it. The <i>TR 303</i> model was especially important because of the 
            new genre of electronic music it birthed, although before its rise in popularity it was deemed to have too complicated an interface. 
            In 1987, a chicago-based group named Phuture compiled a 12 minute composition named "Acid Tracks". The newfound use of the <i>TR 303's</i> resonance capabilities birthed a brand new genre of electronic music: Acid House.
            The <i>Microkorg</i> synth is essentially a more compact version of the original Korg models, much like the Minimoog is to the Moog.
            In order for its performace and effeciency to maintain quality despite its small size, the <i>Microkorg</i> is programmed with DSP analog modeling technology.
            The Eurorack models are the most commonly used in the very present day. They are generally large like the Moog modular, and are quite complicated.</a>
